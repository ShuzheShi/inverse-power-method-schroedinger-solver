This repository contains the source code of the example of Section IV in arXiv:2403.xxxxx, which solves the coupled Schroedinger equation using inverse power method.
Such an example solves the Dirac equation under the presence of external scalar potential and a constant magnetic field.
The same notations are used in the codes and the paper.

The code requires the GNU Scientical Library (gsl).
